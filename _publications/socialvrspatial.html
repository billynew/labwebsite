	<p>One essential function of professional events, such as industry trade shows and academic conferences, is to foster and extend a
person’s connections to others within the com unity of their interest. In this paper, we delve into the emerging prac ice transitioning
these events from physical venues to social VR as a new medium. Specifically, we ask: how does the spatial design in social VR affect
the attendee’s networking behaviors and experiences at these events? To answer this question, we conducted in-situ observations
and in-depth interviews with 13 participants. Each of them had attended or hosted at least one real-world professional event taking
place in social VR. We identified four elements of VR spatial design that shaped social interactions at these events: area size, which
influenced a person’s perceived likelihood of encountering others; pathways connecting areas, which guided their planning of the next
activity to perform; magnets in areas, which facilitated spontaneous gatherings among people; and conventionality, which affected the
assessment of a person’s behavior appropriateness. Some of these elements were interpreted differently depending on the role of the
participant, i.e., event hosts vs. attendees. We concluded this paper with multiple design implications derived from our findings.
